The task is to build a model that will determine the tone that is _**neutral, positive, negative**_ of the text. To do this, you will need to train the model on the existing data. The resulting model will have to determine the class (neutral, positive, negative) of new texts with maximum accuracy.

Preprocessing of the tweets are done by removing stopwords and unwanted symbols in the text.

<h3> The model using Logistic Regression yielded an accuracy of 96%.</h3>
